"""
Branching post-processing for singular declarative constraints.

Singular mining produces one constraint per (template, source, target) with the
set of traces that satisfy it. *Branching* merges several of those singular
constraints into a single branched constraint whose variable side is a *set* of
activities, combined under a logical policy:

    - AND  -> intersection of the satisfying trace sets
    - OR   -> union of the satisfying trace sets
    - XOR  -> exclusive (symmetric) difference of the satisfying trace sets

The merge is greedy and apriori-based, in one of two directions:

    - bottomup : start from the best 2-activity pair and expand one activity at
                 a time while the combined support keeps improving (AND: while it
                 stays above the support floor).
    - topdown  : start from every activity and prune the least useful one at a
                 time until the bound / support floor is reached.

Bound semantics:
    - branching_bound > 0 : maximum number of activities in the branched set.
    - branching_bound == 0: unbounded - stop only when support would drop below
                            the support floor (support_threshold * trace_count).

Scope per category:
    - Pair categories (ordered, unordered) carry a real source -> target pair and
      are branched over whichever side ``branching_type`` selects.
    - Existential constraints (activity, #occurrences) are branched over the
      activity (source) only, grouped by (template, occurrences): activities that
      share the same occurrence count merge into one activity set.
    - Positional constraints (init/end of an activity) have no source/target, so
      the activity is simply extended into a set - one branched init and one
      branched end - and only OR/XOR branching is allowed.
    - Negation constraints are never branched.

Unary branching (existential, positional) always extends the activity side and
runs whenever branching is enabled, independent of ``branching_type``. Branched
constraints report support only; confidence and interest are undefined for an
activity *set* and left null, mirroring the standalone miners.
